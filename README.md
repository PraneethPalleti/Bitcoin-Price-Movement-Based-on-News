# Bitcoin Price Movement Based on News  

## Overview  
This project analyzes Bitcoin price fluctuations based on news sentiment. Using **TextBlob**, sentiment scores were extracted and engineered into features like rolling sentiment averages. **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** models were implemented to predict price movements.  

## Technologies Used  
- `ccxt` – Cryptocurrency exchange market data  
- `NLTK` – Natural Language Processing  
- `yfinance` – Historical Bitcoin price data  
- `textblob` – Sentiment analysis  
- `requests` – Fetching news data  
- `Decision-Making` – Strategy for predictions  

## Features  
- News sentiment extraction & preprocessing  
- Sentiment-based feature engineering  
- Model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest)  
- Performance evaluation and improvement  

## Results  
- Improved prediction accuracy  
- Comparative analysis of models
